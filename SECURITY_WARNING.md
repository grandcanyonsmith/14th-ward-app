# ⚠️ URGENT SECURITY WARNING

## OpenAI API Key Exposed

Your OpenAI API key was accidentally exposed in the chat. Please take these steps immediately:

1. **Go to OpenAI Dashboard**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. **Revoke the exposed key** (the one starting with `sk-proj-_6Jr...`)
3. **Generate a new API key**
4. **Update your Vercel environment variables** with the new key

## Best Practices

- Never share API keys in public chats, commits, or logs
- Always use environment variables for sensitive data
- Consider using Vercel's built-in secrets management
- Enable API key rotation policies when available

## For This Project

Once you have a new API key:
1. Update it in Vercel dashboard
2. Update it in your local `.env.local` file
3. Never commit `.env.local` to git (it's already in .gitignore)
